	<p>
		While the other sections of this documentation covers everything you need
		to know to start using HashOver on your website, some information didn't
		fit into the other sections nicely. Here is some more information in the form
		of answers to common questions. If you have any questions please feel free to
		<a href="http://tildehash.com/?page=author" target="_blank">contact me on my website</a>.
		Also feel free to edit this file on
		<a href="https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
		by adding your question and submitting a pull request, I will merge the pull
		request along with an answer to the question.

		What HTML does HashOver allow in comments?
	</h2>

	<p>
		Users may post comments with a limited number of HTML tags. These tags
		include <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;u&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;big&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, and
		<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> escapes HTML.
	</p>

	<p>
		Users may also include an image in their posts using
		<code>[img]https://example.com/image.jpg[/img]</code>. Images in comments
		are not shown by default, they appear as a Polaroid-esque icon, which
		must be clicked for the image to be shown.
	</p>

	<p>
		All other HTML in a comment will be escaped. The allowed HTML tags are
		case insensitive, but they must appear exactly as stated, no attributes
		or odd spacing, otherwise they too will be escaped. The hyperlink tag
		<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is not allowed in comments, instead users can post
		URLs as-is and they will become links. This is done to help protect users
		against scams and SPAM, since links can't say something different than
		where they actually link to, thereby preventing phishing attacks.
	</p>

	<h2 id="markdown-in-comments">
		Does HashOver support Markdown in comments?
	</h2>

	<p>
		Yes, HashOver supports a limited type of Markdown. The syntax is:
		<code>**bold**</code>, <code>_underline_</code>, <code>*italic*</code>,
		<code>~~strikethrough~~</code>, <code>`highlight`</code>, and
		<code>```code```</code> escapes HTML. Additionally, <code>__bold__</code>
		will force the underline styling and allow it to span multiple lines.
		Markdown support will always remain limited, it will never support the
		<code>[]()</code> hyperlink syntax, but all of the allowed HTML tags will
		eventually be supported as Markdown at least. HTML and Markdown may be
		used together in comments.
